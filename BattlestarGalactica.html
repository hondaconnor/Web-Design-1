      Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he
      takes her to the dance. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're
      late, do you have no concept of time? Oh, great scott. You get the cable,
      I'll throw the rope down to you. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man
      should know too much about their own destiny. Unfortunately no, it
      requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

      god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
